| :------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :--------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| P3.1.1  | Create a new user flag `has_completed_onboarding` in the `Profile` table.                                                                   | Backend          | The migration is created and applied. The column defaults to `false`.                                                           | ✅ Done  | **Major Blocker:** Required a complete, multi-step reset and baseline of the Prisma migration history to work with the existing Supabase `auth` schema. The definitive decoupling strategy is now our standard procedure. |
| P3.1.2  | Create a multi-step wizard component for the onboarding flow.                                                                               | Frontend         | The component manages state for 3 steps: "Loved", "Okay", "Not for You".                                                        | ✅ Done  | Implemented in `src/components/features/onboarding/onboarding-wizard.tsx` using a simple `useState` hook.                                                                                                             |
| P3.1.3  | Create a middleware or a check in the root layout to redirect new users (`has_completed_onboarding` is `false`) to the `/onboarding` route. | Both             | **Verification:** A newly signed-up user is forced into the onboarding flow before they can access the main app.                | ✅ Done  | Logic was added directly to the existing `src/lib/supabase/middleware.ts` file to fetch the user's profile and redirect.                                                                                                |
| P3.1.4  | Implement the "Loved" step UI, including the TMDB search from Phase 1.                                                                      | Frontend         | The UI prompts the user to find a movie they loved and forces a high rating (e.g., 4.5-5 stars).                                | ✅ Done  | Created new, self-contained `OnboardingTmdbSearch` and `OnboardingStarRating` components to support the wizard's state.                                                                                                 |
| P3.1.5  | Implement the "Okay" and "Not for You" steps.                                                                                               | Frontend         | The UI prompts for movies and constrains the rating to the appropriate range (e.g., 2.5-3.5 for "Okay", 1-2 for "Not for You"). | ✅ Done  | Reused the same components, passing different `min`/`max` props to the `OnboardingStarRating` component for each step.                                                                                                |
| P3.1.6  | Create an `onboardLogEntry` Server Action.                                                                                                  | Backend          | This action takes a `tmdb_id` and a `rating` and creates a `LogEntry` in the user's personal space.                             | ✅ Done  | Consolidated into the `completeOnboarding` action for efficiency.                                                                                                                                                     |
| P3.1.7  | Create a final Server Action `completeOnboarding`.                                                                                          | Backend          | **Verification:** This action sets the `has_completed_onboarding` flag on the user's profile to `true`.                         | ✅ Done  | Implemented in `src/actions/onboarding-actions.ts`. It handles all three log entries and the profile update in a single transaction.                                                                                     |
| P3.1.8  | After `completeOnboarding` is successful, redirect the user to their main dashboard.                                                        | Frontend         | The user exits the wizard and lands on their now-populated library page.                                                        | ✅ Done  | Handled via a `redirect('/')` call inside the `completeOnboarding` server action.                                                                                                                                     |

| P3.4.1  | Implement skeleton loaders for data-heavy pages like the library and stats dashboard. | Frontend         | While server components are fetching data, users see a polished loading state instead of a blank page or layout shifts.                         | ✅ Done  | Refactored the main library into a `LibraryGrid` component wrapped in a `<Suspense>` boundary with a skeleton fallback. |
| P3.4.2  | Create custom `error.tsx` files for key routes.                                       | Frontend         | If a server component or action fails, the user sees a friendly error message ("Oops, something went wrong!") instead of a crashed application. | ✅ Done  | Created a global `src/app/error.tsx` and a more specific `src/app/spaces/[spaceId]/error.tsx`.                 |
| P3.4.3  | Add pending/loading states to all forms.                                              | Frontend         | When a form is submitted, the submit button is disabled and shows a spinner to prevent double submissions.                                      | ✅ Done  | Refactored all form components to use the `useTransition` hook for consistent loading states.                 |
| P3.4.4  | Conduct a full UI review against the `design_guideline.md`.                           | Frontend         | Check all spacing, colors, typography, and border radii for consistency across the entire application.                                          | 🟨 Defer  | This task has been moved to a dedicated UI/UX Polish phase (Phase 4).                                       |
| P3.4.5  | Write a comprehensive `README.md` for the project.                                    | Both             | The README explains what Flicklog is, how to set it up locally, and how to run it.                                                              | ✅ Done  | `README.md` created at project root.                                                                        |
| P3.4.6  | Establish the bug tracking process in GitHub Issues.                                  | Both             | Create the "Bug Report" issue template as described in `error_logbook.md`.                                                                      | ✅ Done  | Created `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md`.                                                             |
