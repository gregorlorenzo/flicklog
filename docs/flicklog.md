### **Flicklog: The Definitive Project Blueprint**

### **1. The Vision**

Flicklog is a social platform built around the shared experience of watching movies and TV shows. It provides a beautiful, dedicated home for your viewing history, transforming fleeting opinions and scattered chat messages into a permanent, interactive scrapbook for you and the people you share your passions with.

**Our Mission:** To preserve and celebrate the stories we watch and the memories we create around them, fostering deeper connections through shared cinematic experiences.

### **2. The Core Problem**

Our viewing histories are ephemeral. We recommend films in group chats, post reactions on social media, and keep mental notes of what to watch, but these valuable memories are quickly buried or forgotten. There is no central hub to log, analyze, and reminisce about our cinematic journeys, both as individuals and as a group.

**The Pain Points:**

- Scattered recommendations across multiple chat platforms
- Lost memories of great films discovered months ago
- No way to remember who introduced you to your favorite shows
- Difficulty finding films that satisfied everyone in your group
- Missing context around when and why you watched something

### **3. User Personas**

#### **Maya "The Curator" (Primary Persona)**

- **Age:** 28, Marketing Manager
- **Viewing Habits:** Watches 2-3 movies/week, mostly with her partner
- **Pain Point:** Forgets what they've watched together and struggles to remember which films they both loved
- **Goal:** Wants a beautiful, shared digital scrapbook of their movie nights
- **Tech Comfort:** High - uses multiple apps daily, appreciates good design

#### **The Rodriguez Family (Secondary Persona)**

- **Members:** Parents (45, 42) + two teens (16, 14)
- **Viewing Habits:** Weekly family movie nights, everyone has different tastes
- **Pain Point:** Endless debates about what to watch, forgetting what everyone actually enjoyed
- **Goal:** Track what works for family time and remember the gems that pleased everyone
- **Tech Comfort:** Mixed - parents are moderate users, teens are power users

#### **Jake "The Social Connector" (Secondary Persona)**

- **Age:** 24, College Student
- **Viewing Habits:** Hosts movie nights with rotating friend groups
- **Pain Point:** Wants to share his discoveries and see what friends are watching across different social circles
- **Goal:** Build his reputation as the friend with great movie recommendations
- **Tech Comfort:** Very high - early adopter, shares everything on social media

### **4. The Core Solution: A Platform of "Spaces"**

Flicklog is architected around **Spaces**â€”independent containers for logging and discovery. This structure elegantly serves two distinct use cases:

- **Personal Space:** The default for every user. A private, solo movie diary to log and reflect on everything you watch on your own.
- **Shared Spaces:** A user can create new Spaces and invite friends, partners, or family. This is the collaborative heart of Flicklog, where all members contribute to a single, shared library, creating a permanent record of their collective viewing experiences.

**Space Examples:**

- "Maya & Alex's Movie Nights"
- "The Rodriguez Family Cinema"
- "College Movie Club"
- "Girls' Night Picks"

### **5. The Onboarding Experience: The "Backlog Blitz"**

To combat the "empty app" problem and teach core mechanics, every new user is guided through a one-time onboarding wizard designed to establish their personal rating scale from the very first interaction.

1.  **The High Note:** "First, let's start with a favorite. What's a movie you absolutely **LOVED**?"
2.  **The Middle Ground:** "Now, think of a film that was just... **okay**. A perfectly solid but not mind-blowing watch."
3.  **The Low Note:** "Lastly, what's a movie that really **WASN'T for you**?"

This flow immediately populates the user's library and stats dashboard with meaningful, distributed data, providing an instant payoff and demonstrating the app's value.

**Onboarding Success Metrics:**

- 90% of users complete all three steps
- Users who complete onboarding return within 7 days at 60% rate
- Average time to complete: under 3 minutes

### **6. The Pillars of Flicklog**

#### **Pillar I: The Ritual (Effortless & Detailed Logging)**

- **Intelligent Search:** Easily find any movie, TV series, season, or specific episode, with official details and posters pulled in automatically.
- **5-Star Rating System:** A familiar 5-star system with **half-star increments** for nuanced ratings.
- **Descriptive Labels:** As a user selects a rating, subtle text appears to anchor the score (e.g., 5 Stars = "Masterpiece," 3 Stars = "Good").
- **Rich Contextual Data:**
  - **Date Watched:** Editable field that defaults to the current day.
  - **Who Picked It?:** (In Shared Spaces) A simple selector to track whose choice it was.
  - **Custom Tags:** Add descriptive tags like `Movie Night`, `Cozy`, `Re-watch`, or `Mind-Bender`.
- **Layered Commentary:**
  - **Quick Take:** A short summary or hot take, used for social integrations.
  - **Deeper Thoughts:** A private, larger field for detailed notes and inside jokes that stay within Flicklog.

#### **Pillar II: The Scrapbook (Relive, Analyze & Discover)**

- **The Visual Library:** An interactive gallery of movie posters. Fully sortable and filterable by rating, date, tags, who picked it, and more.
- **The Stats Dashboard:** A page of fun, data-rich visualizations. In Shared Spaces, this includes:
  - **The Critic's Corner:** Identify the "Toughest Critic" and "Most Generous" member.
  - **The Great Divide:** A list of films with the biggest rating disagreements.
  - **Perfect Harmony:** A list of high-rated films you all scored identically.
- **Flicklog Rewind:** A nostalgia feature on the dashboard showing what you were watching on this day in previous years.

#### **Pillar III: The Social Fabric (Connect & Share)**

- **The "Pending Ratings" System:** To ensure balanced participation in Shared Spaces, when one person logs a film, other members receive a "**Your Turn!**" notification, prompting them to add their rating to the pending entry.
- **Optional Integrations:** On a per-Space basis, connect to external services. The primary integration is:
  - **Discord:** Automatically posts a beautiful, rich embed of a new review to a designated channel, featuring the poster, ratings, Quick Take, and other details.
